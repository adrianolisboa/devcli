# This configuration defines the cases where 'handle_interface'
# is used. A subcommand can have different implementations
# while keeping the same CLI.
#
# As an example a command like 'devcli pass get ping' will
# retrieve a password by the 'ping' key. This can be
# implemented using different methods of password keeping.

# To select one implementation for a subcommand
# interface use the following syntax:
#
# ["SUBCOMMAND"]="implementation_to_use"
#
# If the SUBCOMMAND is not found in this map it is assumed
# the SUBCOMMAND is the concrete implementation. Since
# the implementation is loaded using the 'use' function,
# implementatons must be named with a '_' prefix.

# subcommand pass delegates to the
# password-store implementation
cmdmap['pass']="password-store"
