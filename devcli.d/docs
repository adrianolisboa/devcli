CMDMAP - Mapping subcommands to different implementations

Using CMDMAP it is possible to map a subcommand to a implementation. In
the 'conf/cmdmap' is defined an associative array that tells devcli
to forward the arguments to another file. For example:

Let's say we have a subcommand called 'date' which formats
TIMESTAMP into readable dates, like so:

devcli date to_date 1234567890

If in 'conf/cmdmap' we find:

['date']='macos_date'

This means that 'devcli' will delegate the subcommand parameters to the file
'_macos_date' and that file has one implementation of 'to_date'.  Now, let's
say we want to use the same command on a linux machine. Unfortunetelly macos'
and linux's date utility uses different arguments to parse a timestamp.

MacOS:
date -r TIMESTAMP

Linux:
date -d @TIMESTAMP

This could force us to have two different actions for 'date' something like:

devcli date linux_to_date TIMESTAMP

and

devcli date macos_to_date TIMESTAMP

Which works but is not ideal. The point of abstracting the details of some
commands is broken if we define different syntaxes for different OSes. Using
the CMDMAP we can dynamically decide which implementation we wnat to use. In
'conf/cmdmap' we can write:

date_handler=\$( __osx && echo "macos_date" || echo "linux_date" \)
cmdmap["date"]="\${date_handler\}"

In this case depending on which OS the devcli is running it will load different
implementaions while it keeps the same interface so:

devcli date to_date TIMESTAMP

Will work in both MacOS and Linux. This example is implemented into 'devcli'
you can explore the files 'conf/cmdmap', 'devcli.d/date',
'devcli.d/_linux_date' and 'devcli.d/_macos_date' to learn more about it.
